# UploadFileSample

Sample Console App that showcases how to do a large file upload. 

This can be done in two ways.
  - Uploading the file slice by slice and keeping track of the upload yourself.
  - Giving the stream to be uploaded to the task and let it handle the slice upload. With this method, you can give the task an object to monitor updates.
  
  Both ways have been demonstrated in the sample app.
